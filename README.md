# NLP-Analysis-for-Students-Posts

This project is written in Python and is still in progress. Because of privacy, the data is not provided (the data is in .txt format of different year's students' posts). The team also build a dashboard to visualize students' posts, which could be found here: https://tltl-knowledgemap-demo.herokuapp.com/.

The .py in Basic NLP includes fundemental steps for NLP, like lowercasing words, removing URLs, tokenize strings into individual words, stopwords and punctuation removal, stemming, lemmatizing and so forth.


The .py in Token Classification is an example of using existing models to do higher level analysis. The .ipynb in Use GPT-4 uses GPT-4 to do NLP analysis.

I have also explored other ways of NLP analysis like sentiment analysis, topic modeling, summarizing and so on. The analyzing process is similar as token classification.

Also exploring using popular models like GPT.
