# NLP-Analysis-for-Students-Posts

This project is written in Python and is still in progress.

The .py in Basic NLP includes fundemental steps for NLP, like lowercasing words, removing URLs, tokenize strings into individual words, stopwords and punctuation removal, stemming, lemmatizing and so forth.


The .py in Token Classification is an example of using existing models to do higher level analysis.

I have also explored other ways of NLP analysis like sentiment analysis, topic modeling, summarizing and so on. Also exploring using popular models like GPT.
